            and Pavelon is aware of this. SOC 2, Type II attestation and PCI-DSS
            certification, both obtained in Q4 2021, are among the independent
            audits that reputable outside partners have conducted on Pavelon.
            Pavelon is still committed to these areas of independent validations
            and continues to invest in certifications, attestations, and
            validations.
